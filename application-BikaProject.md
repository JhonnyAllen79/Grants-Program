### Overview
What is Bika Token?
Bika Token (BKT) is a Binance Smart chain(BSC) and Polkadot (DOT) based token that serves as a payment and reward for writers and novel readers on the upcoming Bika Novel platform. We created this token with the aim of increasing the creativity of writers while producing writers talented, Everyone can join our platform, novice writers and professional writers. Because we really handle all the work and they deserve to be rewarded according to the work they create, If tokens were created to address the concerns of writers due to very small income and very difficult payments, We want to make all that easier with a decentralized system.


Please provide the following:


- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).

   Bika Token is a decentralized Defi and novel project.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:


- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

  The project will use Blockchain as a recipient and token transaction, build with substrate resources, and build a community.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

   The project's target market is the use, DEX, and bika wallet as mvp products made.

- What need(s) does your project meet?

   Bika project already has a solid team, has good job support software, and creative innovation development ideas.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?

   No similar project
  
- If so, how is your project different?
  
   The bika project brings online novels in and creative innovations. Different from other competitors.
  
- If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
  
   Bika project is different because it has a novel application as an mvp product, Bika is a unique project with a myriad of features and innovations.

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:


- academic publications relevant to the problem,

   Explanation of testing and working procedures to all.

- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,

   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R77DArqWtZEl-HCf-5OZVtIK7pQjXUQS/view?usp=drivesdk

- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,

   We discuss on project and web3 for project development and web3 development.

- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ybTJF5hDS_zgS6HgXbGSR0WkTxV83oQW/view?usp=drivesdk


## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:


- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.

   The project is built with good software, namely react native for DEX development, Visual code applications, node.js, vue.js, and typescript.

- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.

   10,000 USD

- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.

   The script data file will be shared on the github repository about the whole project work.

- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.

   Testing will be presented in the Bika block, bug testing, frontend testing, thorough testing and the entire presentation will be witnessed.

- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.

   Doker is used for shipping and for the process of displacement as expected.

- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
 
   It takes 5 months/3FTE and 3 workers for each achievement.

- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

   Miliston has tests but can't provide shareable encoding due to being a tester.

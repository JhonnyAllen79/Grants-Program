### Overview
What is Bika Token?
Bika Token (BKT) is a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polkadot (DOT) based 
token that serves as a payment and reward for writers 
and novel readers on the upcoming Bika Novel 
platform. We created this token with the aim of 
increasing the creativity of writers while producing 
writers talented, Everyone can join our platform, novice 
writers and professional writers. Because we really 
handle all the work and they deserve to be rewarded 
according to the work they create, If tokens were 
created to address the concerns of writers due to very 
small income and very difficult payments, We want to 
make all that easier with a decentralized system.

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
Bika Token is a decentralized Defi and novel project.
- A brief description of your project.
Bika is an online Novel platform and token exchange(DEX), Bika is used for payments, farm/staking, Nft market, Liquidity, rewards in novel apps.
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
The project will be built on Polygon and substrate, Dex development with substrate resources, project as part of the polkadot community, and use the polkadot Blockchain for centralized application development.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
The Bika project is a unique project and has a good ecosystem, the team hopes the project can progress with innovation for Bika, that's why the team wants to give their best to make the project.

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
UI design for Dapps and decentralized novels.
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
API specifications according to applications created with new features.
- An overview of the technology stack to be used

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ybTJF5hDS_zgS6HgXbGSR0WkTxV83oQW/view?usp=drivesdk
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
Creation and development of Dapps and decentralized applications. MVP products are BikaSwap, BikaWallet, Bika Novel, Game meta.
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
Hope the project has success and has a prosthesis to develop in the future.
### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
The project will use Blockchain as a recipient and token transaction, build with substrate resources, and build a community.
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
The project's target market is the use, DEX, and bika wallet as mvp products made.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
Gunding requirements for development tools, coding resource requirements, supporting software.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
No similar project
 - If so, how is your project different?
The bika project brings online novels in and creative innovations. Different from other competitors.
 - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
Bika project is different because it has a novel application as an mvp product, Bika is a unique project with a myriad of features and innovations.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
The project is built with good software, namely react native for DEX development, Visual code applications, node.js, vue.js, and typescript.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
10,000 USDT
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
The script data file will be shared on the github repository about the whole project work.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
Testing will be presented in the Bika block, bug testing, frontend testing, thorough testing and the entire presentation will be witnessed.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
Doker is used for shipping and for the process of displacement as expected.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
It takes 5 months/3FTE and 3 workers for each achievement.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).
Miliston has tests but can't provide shareable encoding due to being a tester.
> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
